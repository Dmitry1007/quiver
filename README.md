## Surfboard Purchase Tracking App
App that allows users to track their surfboard(anything really) purchases.
Main reason for building this was to better understand React Redux Toolkit. 

Cool, probs not so impressive features:
 - Add/Delete new purchases. 
 - Filter/Fuzzy-Search purchases by name. 
 - View total cost of purchases.
 - Update total cost based on results of filter/Fuzzy-Search
 - Make existing list items **Bold** if they fuzzy match when starting to add a new item. 

App Techy Stuffs:
 - created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
 - state managed by [React Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
 - style using [Bulma](https://bulma.io)
 - persistence? You're gonna have to add that ;)
 - Test? Aint got time for that right now.
 - License? Do whatchu want with it ;)
